          <p><i>A reflection on creating this portfolio website</i><br></p>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The following steps were taken in my process for creating this website.</p>
          
          <ol>
            <h4>Setting the Foundation â€” Repository</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Created github repository</li>
              <li>Downloaded zip of example files provided by instructor</li> 
              <li>Renamed and added additional folders and files to and uploaded files to Github repository</li> 
            </ol>
          
            <h4>Creating the Home Page</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Created header</li> 
              <li>Adding links to different pages</li>
              <li>Modifying link style to underline when hover and to remain white</li>
              <li>Modifying background color Learning why gap for background - needed to specify margin for body to remove default 8px</li>
              <li>Learning how to import external fonts (Google Fonts) for further customization</li>
              <li>Figuring how to center the tabs within the header container</li>
              <li>How to adjust the home page logo and tabs left and right (using absolute and relative position, etc.)</li>
              <li>Creating divs to group together content for images (involved learning about flexbox, align-items, justify-content, etc.)</li> 
              <li>Working on centering project containers into center of the page</li> 
              <li>Researching types of CSS transitions. Played around with scale, text color changing on hover. Wanted to customize code with by creating a method with a parameter of color like you can do in Java, but decided this exploration was out of scope for this project.</li> 
              <li>Adding more polished elements of the home page -- adding a colored rectangular container box for each project</li> 
              <li>Simplified CSS transitions applying -- scaling the image when hover</li>
              <li>Researched links. Modified header links to make sure indexing? and returning to right levels of directory to access correct folders files under</li>
            </ol>
          
            <h4>Creating the Cheatsheets Page</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Involved creating styling for spacing and indenting content to distinguish between the different sections of content on the page (e.g., description of code vs sample code)</li>
              <li>Researching css for buttons to refresh</li> 
              <li>Researching refresher on link properties and how to design links to open in a new tab</li> 
            </ol>

            <h4>Creating the About Me Page</h4> 
            <ol>
              <li>Modifying CSS from home page, index.css, to carry over styling.</li>  
              <li>Centering image and bio description on page</li>  
              <li>Researching and trouble shooting why picture not loading when viewing on live website</li> 
            </ol>
          
            <h4>Creating the Reflection Page</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Creating reflections fold and css and html files and adding reflections page to header of other pages and adding content to that page</li> 
            </ol>

            <h4>Styling across pages</h4> 
            <ol>
              <li>Last minute style changes like keeping the tab active underlined</li> 
            </ol> 
        </ol>
        
        <p>Continuously committing changes throughout the cycle</p>

        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p> One issue I encountered while making this website was with creating urls to navigate between the different website pages. If accessing one of the tabs from a page other than the home page, one would get a 404 error. Looking at the url in the web browser revealed that the paths were being stacked on each other, rather than being refreshed. Because I set up the directory to have a folder for the code associated with each page, the urls needed to move up into the parent directories instead of further down nonexistent subdirectories. I troubleshooted this by reading through a Developer Mozilla HTML guide to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks" target="_blank">creating hyperlinks</a>I found that the urls I created in the html files needed to be proceeded by two periods (..) to move back to the parent directory before accessing the sub-directories each page's code was under.</p>
        
        <div class="spacer-big"></div>
        <h3>CSS Transition</h3>
        <p>I applied a time-scaling CSS transition to the images associated with each project on the home page. When hovering over the image, the image's size increases by 10%.</p>
        <p>I chose this transition because it would help to emphasize the visual content of each project to further grab users' attention.</p>
        <p>To implement this CSS transition, I first researched the different types of CSS transitions and transition properties supported, such as through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer</a> and <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/css-transitions/" target="_blank">Josh W Comeau's CSS Transition guide</a>. I then attempted to create this transition. After finding that the image was not centering in the larger container of each project, I looked on Stackoverflow to see if anyone else had encountered this problem, including this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28726430/css-how-to-scale-an-image-from-the-center-instead-of-top-left" target="_blank"></a>thread I think looked on Stackflow to see if anyone else had encountered a similar problem. The suggestions made didn't apply to my scenario, and after exploring with the inspector developer tools, I found that it had to do with the display flex and align-items properties of the overarching divs applied to the larger group of content including the image.</p>
        <p>Below is a gif demonstrating this functionality.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div style="display: flex;justify-content:center">
          <img src="./csstransitiondemo.gif" style="width:auto;height:300px;">
        </div>
        
        <div class="spacer-big"></div>
