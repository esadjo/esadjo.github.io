        <p>The core functionality of this project is that a user can type in and enter a location (e.g., a city), select a plant, and toggle on the "Launch World" toggle to add a persistent plant world to their web browser. This plant world reflects the weather of the location inputted and is remembered across tabs and when the page is refreshed. The plant type selected by users is displayed within the plant world.</p>

        <p>To be able to run the code that produces this browser extension, go to my GitHub repository called <a href="https://github.com/esadjo/finalproject-prototype1" target="_blank" class="a-2">finalproject-prototype1</a>, click on the top right green button "Code" and select "Download Zip" from the dropdown menu. Navigate to your downloads folder and open up the zip. The next step is to open chrome://extensions/ in your Google Chrome browser. Click on the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner and then select the sub-folder "web browser plant world" within the folder "finalproject-prototype1-main" you unzipped earlier. Click on the extension icon in the web browser top toolbar and pin the Web Browser Plant extension to your toolbar. Navigate to a web page and start using the browser extension!</p>

        <h2 style="color:#1D5505">Development Process</h2>
        <p>The steps I took for this project closely followed the development process I specified in my <a href="https://esadjo.github.io/projects/finalprojectproposal.html" target="_blank" class="a-2">project proposal</a>. I specifically: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Created a new repository by cloning my MP1 web browser extension GitHub repository as a starting point.</li>
          <li>Added text input and location placeholders to the popup.</li>
          <li>Worked on the popup files (mainly popup.js) to save the location a user inputs.</li>
          <li>Worked on calling and storing the Weather API to retrieve the current weather conditions of the location inputted by the user.</li>
          <li>Added all the visual elements of the plant world to a block element overlayed on top of the web pages. The weather icon is retrieved from the Weather API and the selection of plants is based on the framework I created for my MP1 assignment.</li>
          <li>Set up setinterval to ensure that the Weather API is called every couple of minutes. For testing purposes, I made the interval a minute long to get immediate feedback and reverted it to every 15 minutes afterward.</li>
          <li>Troubleshot problems with the location not being remembered when you refresh the page or move to a different tab, working across the popup and content script javascript files.</li>
          <li>Modified the content script files so that the Weather API is called when a user inputs a new location, regardless of the timeline of the setinterval function.</li></li>
          <li>Tested the web browser to make sure the core functionality is working.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="spacer">
          <div style="display: flex;justify-content:center">
            <img src="/images/progressfinalprojectprotoype.png" style="width:1300px;height:auto;">
            
          </div>
          <div style="display: flex;justify-content:center">
            <p><i>Prototype built over time.</i></p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <h2 style="color:#1D5505">Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>One logic error I ran into was that the location input value specified by users through the popup was not remembered when you navigated to a new tab or refreshed the page. By using console.log statements, I was able to understand whether or not the location value was being saved and whether it was being communicated from the popup to the content scripts. Through this method and asking clarifying questions during office hours, I was able to pinpoint that the location inputted by users was not being saved properly because I was missing the location in the message sent between my popup and content script js files. In the process, I learned more about how chrome storage and chrome runtime work. I learned that simply saving a variable like location with chrome.storage and then attempting to retrieve it in the popup won't allow the variable to be properly remembered within the content scripts files. Sending the value through a chrome runtime message is needed to communicate between different contexts (e.g., 2 tabs).</p>

        <h2 style="color:#1D5505">Ideas and Future Work</h2>
        <p>Some ideas I might consider implementing in the future are the stretch goals described in my proposal. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Establishing a counting system and warning message for when users are close to reaching their max number of "refreshes" of the browser because there is a limited number of calls to the API that can be made each month (1,000,000 per month).</li>
          <li>Allowing users to save a list of locations for easy access.</li>
          <li>Allowing users to change the size and location of the plant world.</li>
          <li>Allowing users to 'plant' multiple plants in the plant world instead of just one.</li>
          <li>Animating the plants to grow over time.</li>
          <li>Animating the weather conditions instead of having them be static.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        
        <h2 style="color:#1D5505">Kudos</h2>
        <p>In addition to going in-class office hours to try to pinpoint how to save and remember the location inputted by users, I also used the following online resources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx" target="_blank" class="a-2">The Weather API's Interactive API Explorer</a> to determine the elements needed to make an API call and what the response structure is.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/example-fetch/blob/main/index.js" target="_blank" class="a-2">The Professor's Example Fetch</a> to revisit how to fetch data from an API.</li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch" target="_blank" class="a-2">Mozilla Developer article on "Using the Fetch API"</a> to learn more about Fetch API.</li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval" target="_blank" class="a-2">A Mozilla Developer explanation of setInterval()</a> to determine how to run the function calling the Weather API to retrieve the weather details every 15-30 minutes.</li>
          <li>By proxy, any resources that were used to make my MP1 <a href="https://esadjo.github.io/projects/browserextension.html" target="_blank" class="a-2">Web Browser Plant Extension</a> because I built upon my code from MP1. (See my Kudos section from that project for specifics).</li>
