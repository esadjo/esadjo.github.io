        <h2 style="color:#8B2019">Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p>The core functionality of this project is that in the game, users control a blue balloon. Using the arrow controller keys on their keyboard, users can move the balloon left, right, up, and down at a set speed. If the balloon moves off the page, it reappears on the other side (left to right side of screen, top to bottom of screen, and vice versa) to keep the player in the game. Meanwhile, fireballs rotating at different speeds move across the screen, which the user has to avoid. If the user's balloon gets hit by a fireball, then the balloon expands. If the score reaches 35 hits, the game is over.</p>
        <p>Smaller functionalities included in this game are that the background is responsive. As the balloon acquires more hits and expands, the background red arches further shift to the right side of the screen. The game includes instructions in the center bottom of the screen to guide users at the beginning of the game and disappears after the user begins the game and has a score of 2 hits. Additionally, another functionality is that users can click anywhere on the screen to play or pause the game background music. By default, the music is off. The sound icon in the top right corner updates to show which sound state is selected.</p>

        <p>You can access the game below:</p>

        <h2 style="color:#8B2019">Development Process</h2>
        <p>The steps I took for this project included:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Following an in-class <a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/web-technologies/blob/main/activities/06_toolchain.md" target="_blank" class="a-2">Dev Toolchain Walkthrough</a> activity to install libraries.</li>
          <li>Reading up on P5.play functions through the <a href="https://p5play.org/learn/" target="_blank" class="a-2">P5.play library</a>.</li>
          <li>Going through examples in <a href="https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/" target="_blank" class="a-2">Allison Parrish's "Making Games with p5.play"</a> tutorials and observing which P5.play functions they leveraged to create their interactions and animations. In the Kudos section, I specify which examples I studied in particular.</li>
          <li>Building out the most basic functionality of the game and then working my way up to building the more complex attributes. This involved first creating a sprite for the player and having it controlled by the arrow keys. I then added the fireballs and defined their moving behavior, wrote the code to make the balloon expand when it overlaps with the fireballs, and added background effects such as the background arcs moving right as the number of hits increase. I then added visual elements such as the score number of hits at the top of the screen, and then a control for sound. I focused on working on the elements involving p5 and p5.play first, and then worked on adding the sound elements with p5.sound.</li>
          <li>Debugging errors that occurred along the way via the console. I attended office hours for errors I had trouble solving on my own.</li>
          <li>Revisiting the in-class activity again to figure out how to set up the live server to serve my code and bundle it with Rollup. This included getting help via Discord to double check my understanding of instructions.</li>
          <li>Following an <a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/example-game" target="_blank" class="a-2">example game</a> provided by the professor to double check my process for bundling my code up with Rollup.</li>
          <li>Deploying the game to Github pages.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 style="color:#8B2019">Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>One logic error I ran into occurred when I defined the keyboard controls of the balloon player. When using the right arrow key to attempt to move the balloon to the right, the balloon's position would not update. Using console.log, I found that the number for keycode (which distinguishes between which key controls are selected) wasn't updating for the right arrow after the first move was made. I found that the error was occurring because the balloon's direction and speed were being set together, rather than separately. Instead of using setSpeed, I resolved the issue by defining the player speed and direction using separate functions. This was an error that I received help in my interpretation of its meaning during office hours. What I learned along the way was how to better interpret the error messages provided within the console to narrow down what the source of the problem might be.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#8B2019">Ideas and Future Work</h2>
        <p>Some ideas I might consider implementing in the future include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allowing users to choose the game difficulty level. This would be controlled by the speed of the fireballs, how many fireballs there are, the size of the fireballs, the speed of the balloon, etc. </li>
          <li>Providing player customization: users being able to choose other player avatars besides a balloon. Alternatively, this could entail users being able to specify the color of the balloon.</li>
          <li>Allowing users to customize the game setting by being able to choose between a selection of game backgrounds.</li>
          <li>Implementing a life system and incrementing the game's difficulty across several stages for a larger game journey.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        
        <h2 style="color:#8B2019">Kudos</h2>
        <p>In addition to going to office hours for the keyboard navigation error described above, I also received help from the teaching staff when deploying the game site.</p>
        <p>I also used the following online resources to help me in my creation of the game:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An in-class <a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/web-technologies/blob/main/activities/06_toolchain.md" target="_blank" class="a-2">Dev Toolchain Walkthrough</a> to learn how to install libraries and set up a live server to serve my code</li>
          <li><a href="https://p5play.org/learn/" target="_blank" class="a-2">P5.play library references</a> to learn about <a href="https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html?page=3" target="_blank" class="a-2">Sprite Images</a>, <a href="https://p5play.org/learn/sprite_animation.html?page=1" target="_blank" class="a-2">animations and scaling</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://p5js.org/reference/" target="_blank" class="a-2">P5.js library references</a> to learn about adding <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/image-background-image.html" target="_blank" class="a-2">background images</a>, <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/textStyle" target="_blank" class="a-2">text styles</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/" target="_blank" class="a-2">Allison Parrish's "Making Games with p5.play"</a> written tutorials. I specifically looked at the examples "Sprite Groups" when creating the fireball group sprites, "Sprites on the move" to code the keyboard navigation controls of the balloon user player, "Collision callbacks" to structure my code for what happens when the balloon hits (aka overlaps) with the fireballs, and "Images and animations" for adding images to sprites.</li>
          <li><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/mbardin/sketches/OyZLpQW6N" target="_blank" class="a-2">An example moving sprites project</a> to understand how to specify the position and rotations of the fireballs</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/example-game" target="_blank" class="a-2">Branchwelder's Example Game</a> to follow an example of defining scripts within package.json</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Lastly, the audio <a href="https://www.jamendo.com/track/1254647/game" target="_blank" class="a-2">"Game" by STMUSIC</a> was used as the background music of the game.</p>
